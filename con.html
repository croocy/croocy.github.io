       <h1> The Cop and the Anthem </h1>
O N HIS BENCH IN MADISON SQUARE Soapy moved uneasily. When 
wild goose honk high of nights, and when women without sealskin 
coats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy moves 
uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is 
near at hand. 
A dead leaf fell in Soapy's lap. That was Jack Frost's card. Jack is 
kind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair 
warning of his annual call. At the corners of four streets he hands 
his pasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All 
Outdoors, so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready. 
Soapy's mind became cognizant of the fact that the time had 
come for him to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways 
and Means to provide against the coming rigour. And therefore he 
moved uneasily on his bench. 
The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. 
In them were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of 
soporific Southern skies or drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three 
months on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of 
assured board and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas 
and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable. 
For years the hospitable Blackwell's had been his winter quar-
ters. Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought 
their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy 
had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the 
Island. And now the time was come. On the previous night three 
Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles 
and over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his 
bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square. So the 
Island loomed large and timely in Soapy's mind. He scorned the 
provisions made in the name of charity for the city's dependents.
     
     
   In Soapy's opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy. 
There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and 
eleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and 
food accordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy's proud 
spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must 
pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands 
of philanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity 
must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of 
a private and personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a 
guest of the law, which, though conducted by rules, does not 
meddle unduly with a gentleman's private affairs. 
Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about 
accomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing 
this. The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive 
restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over 
quietly and without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating 
magistrate would do the rest. 
Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across 
the level sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow 
together, Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a glittering café, 
where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the 
grape, the silkworm and the protoplasm. 
Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest 
upward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, 
ready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady mis-
sionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restau-
rant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that 
would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's 
mind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the 
thing - with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse 
and a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total 
would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of 
revenge from the café management; and yet the meat would leave 
him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge. 
But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head 
waiter's eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. 
Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in 
silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of 
the menaced mallard. 
Soapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the cov-
eted Island was not to be an epicurean one.  Some other way of 
entering limbo must be thought of.
     
     At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly dis-
played wares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. 
Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass. People 
came running round the corner, a policeman in the lead. Soapy 
stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of 
brass buttons. 
'Where's the man that done that?' inquired the officer excitedly. 
'Don't you figure out that I might have had something to do 
with it?' said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one 
greets good fortune. 
The policeman's mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. 
Men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law's 
minions. They take to their heels. The policeman saw a man half-
way down the block running to catch a car. With drawn club he 
joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed 
along, twice unsuccessful. 
On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great 
pretensions. It catered to large appetites and modest purses. Its 
crockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin. 
Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and tell-tale trousers 
without challenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flap-
jacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter he betrayed the 
fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers. 
'Now, get busy and call a cop,' said Soapy. 'And don't keep a 
gentleman waiting.' 
'No cop for youse,' said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes 
and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. 'Hey, Con!' 
Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters 
pitched Soapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter's rule opens, 
and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy 
dream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood 
before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the 
street. 
Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to 
woo capture again. This time the opportunity presented what he 
fatuously termed to himself a 'cinch.' A young woman of a modest 
and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with 
sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and 
two yards from the window a large policeman of severe 
demeanour leaned against a water-plug. 
It was Soapy's design to assume the role of the despicable and 
execrated 'masher.' The refined and elegant appearance of his
     
     victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him 
to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon 
his arm that would ensure his winter quarters on the right little, 
tight little isle. 
Soapy straightened the lady missionary's ready-made tie, 
dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open, set his hat at a killing 
cant and sidled toward the young woman. He made eyes at her, 
was taken with sudden coughs and 'hems,' smiled, smirked and 
went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of 
the 'masher.' With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was 
watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps, 
and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving 
mugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat 
and said: 
'Ah there, Bedelia! Don't you want to come and play in my 
yard?' 
The policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman 
had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route 
for his insular haven. Already he imagined he could feel the cosy 
warmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and, 
stretching out a hand, caught Soapy's coat-sleeve. 
'Sure, Mike,' she said joyfully, 'if you'll blow me to a pail of 
suds. I'd have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.' 
With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak 
Soapy walked past the policeman, overcome with gloom. He 
seemed doomed to liberty. 
At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He 
halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, 
hearts, vows and librettos. Women in furs and men in greatcoats 
moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear seized Soapy that some 
dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The 
thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon 
another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent 
theatre he caught at the immediate straw of 'disorderly conduct.' 
On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the 
top of his harsh voice. He danced, howled, raved and otherwise 
disturbed the welkin. 
The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and 
remarked to a citizen: 
' 'Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin' the goose egg they give 
to the Hartford College. Noisy; but no harm. We've instructions 
to lave them be.'
     
     
     Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a 
policeman lay hands on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an 
unattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling 
wind. 
In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a 
swinging light. His silk umbrella he had set by the door on enter-
ing. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off 
with it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily. 
'My umbrella,' he said sternly. 
'Oh, is it?' sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. 'Well, 
why don't you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why 
don't you call a cop? There stands one at the corner.' 
The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a 
presentiment that luck would again run against him. The policeman 
looked at the two curiously. 
'Of course,' said the umbrella man - 'that is - well, you know 
how these mistakes occur - I - if it's your umbrella I hope you'll 
excuse me - I picked it up this morning in a restaurant - If you 
recognize it as yours, why - I hope you'll - ' 
'Of course it's mine,' said Soapy viciously. 
The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist 
a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street 
car that was approaching two blocks away. 
Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improve-
ments. He hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He 
muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. 
Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to 
regard him as a king who could do no wrong. 
At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where 
the glitter and turmoil was but faint. He set his face down this 
toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct survives even 
when the home is a park bench. 
But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. 
Here was an old church, quaint and rambling and gabled. 
Through one violet-stained window a soft light glowed, where, no 
doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mas-
tery of the coming Sabbath anthem. For there drifted out to 
Soapy's ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed 
against the convolutions of the iron fence. 
The moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedes-
trians were few; sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves - for a 
little while the scene might have been a country churchyard. And
     
    the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron 
fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained 
such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and 
immaculate thoughts and collars. 
The conjunction of Soapy's receptive state of mind and the 
influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful 
change in his soul. He viewed with swift horror the pit into which 
he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, 
wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence. 
And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this 
novel mood. An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to 
battle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of the 
mire; he would make a man of himself again; he would conquer 
the evil that had taken possession of him. There was time; he was 
comparatively young yet; he would resurrect his old eager ambi-
tions and pursue them without faltering. Those solemn but sweet 
organ notes had set up a revolution in him. To-morrow he would 
go into the roaring down-town district and find work. A fur 
importer had once offered him a place as driver. He would find 
him to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody 
in the world. He would -
Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around 
into the broad face of a policeman. 
'What are you doin' here?' asked the officer. 
'Nothin',' said Soapy. 
'Then come along,' said the policeman. 
'Three months on the Island,' said the Magistrate in the Police 
Court the next morning.

Guy de Maupassant
A Piece of String
It was market-day, and from all the country round Goderville the peasants and their wives were coming toward the town. The men walked slowly, throwing the whole body forward at every step of their long, crooked legs. They were deformed from pushing the plough which makes the left- shoulder higher, and bends their figures side-ways; from reaping the grain, when they have to spread their legs so as to keep on their feet. Their starched blue blouses, glossy as though varnished, ornamented at collar and cuffs with a little embroidered design and blown out around their bony bodies, looked very much like balloons about to soar, whence issued two arms and two feet.

     Some of these fellows dragged a cow or a calf at the end of a rope. And just behind the animal followed their wives beating it over the back with a leaf-covered branch to hasten its pace, and carrying large baskets out of which protruded the heads of chickens or ducks. These women walked more quickly and energetically than the men, with their erect, dried-up figures, adorned with scanty little shawls pinned over their flat bosoms, and their heads wrapped round with a white cloth, enclosing the hair and surmounted by a cap.

     Now a char-a-banc passed by, jogging along behind a nag and shaking up strangely the two men on the seat, and the woman at the bottom of the cart who held fast to its sides to lessen the hard jolting.

     In the market-place at Goderville was a great crowd, a mingled multitude of men and beasts. The horns of cattle, the high, long-napped hats of wealthy peasants, the headdresses of the women came to the surface of that sea. And the sharp, shrill, barking voices made a continuous, wild din, while above it occasionally rose a huge burst of laughter from the sturdy lungs of a merry peasant or a prolonged bellow from a cow tied fast to the wall of a house.

     It all smelled of the stable, of milk, of hay and of perspiration, giving off that half-human, half-animal odor which is peculiar to country folks.

<  2  >

     Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, had just arrived at Goderville and was making his way toward the square when he perceived on the ground a little piece of string. Maitre Hauchecorne, economical as are all true Normans, reflected that everything was worth picking up which could be of any use, and he stooped down, but painfully, because he suffered from rheumatism. He took the bit of thin string from the ground and was carefully preparing to roll it up when he saw Maitre Malandain, the harness maker, on his doorstep staring at him. They had once had a quarrel about a halter, and they had borne each other malice ever since. Maitre Hauchecorne was overcome with a sort of shame at being seen by his enemy picking up a bit of string in the road. He quickly hid it beneath his blouse and then slipped it into his breeches, pocket, then pretended to be still looking for something on the ground which he did not discover and finally went off toward the market-place, his head bent forward and his body almost doubled in two by rheumatic pains.

     He was at once lost in the crowd, which kept moving about slowly and noisily as it chaffered and bargained. The peasants examined the cows, went off, came back, always in doubt for fear of being cheated, never quite daring to decide, looking the seller square in the eye in the effort to discover the tricks of the man and the defect in the beast.

     The women, having placed their great baskets at their feet, had taken out the poultry, which lay upon the ground, their legs tied together, with terrified eyes and scarlet combs.

     They listened to propositions, maintaining their prices in a decided manner with an impassive face or perhaps deciding to accept the smaller price offered, suddenly calling out to the customer who was starting to go away:

     "All right, I'll let you have them, Mait' Anthime."

     Then, little by little, the square became empty, and when the Angelus struck midday those who lived at a distance poured into the inns.

<  3  >
     At Jourdain's the great room was filled with eaters, just as the vast court was filled with vehicles of every sort -- wagons, gigs, chars-a- bancs, tilburies, innumerable vehicles which have no name, yellow with mud, misshapen, pieced together, raising their shafts to heaven like two arms, or it may be with their nose on the ground and their rear in the air.

     Just opposite to where the diners were at table the huge fireplace, with its bright flame, gave out a burning heat on the backs of those who sat at the right. Three spits were turning, loaded with chickens, with pigeons and with joints of mutton, and a delectable odor of roast meat and of gravy flowing over crisp brown skin arose from the hearth, kindled merriment, caused mouths to water.

     All the aristocracy of the plough were eating there at Mait' Jourdain's, the innkeeper's, a dealer in horses also and a sharp fellow who had made a great deal of money in his day.

     The dishes were passed round, were emptied, as were the jugs of yellow cider. Every one told of his affairs, of his purchases and his sales. They exchanged news about the crops. The weather was good for greens, but too wet for grain.

     Suddenly the drum began to beat in the courtyard before the house. Every one, except some of the most indifferent, was on their feet at once and ran to the door, to the windows, their mouths full and napkins in their hand.

     When the public crier had finished his tattoo he called forth in a jerky voice, pausing in the wrong places:

     "Be it known to the inhabitants of Goderville and in general to all persons present at the market that there has been lost this morning on the Beuzeville road, between nine and ten o'clock, a black leather pocketbook containing five hundred francs and business papers. You are requested to return it to the mayor's office at once or to Maitre Fortune Houlbreque, of Manneville. There will be twenty francs reward."

<  4  >
     Then the man went away. They heard once more at a distance the dull beating of the drum and the faint voice of the crier. Then they all began to talk of this incident, reckoning up the chances which Maitre Houlbreque had of finding or of not finding his pocketbook again.

     The meal went on. They were finishing their coffee when the corporal of gendarmes appeared on the threshold.

     He asked:

     "Is Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, here?"

     Maitre Hauchecorne, seated at the other end of the table answered:

     "Here I am, here I am."

     And he followed the corporal.

     The mayor was waiting for him, seated in an armchair. He was the notary of the place, a tall, grave man of pompous speech.

     "Maitre Hauchecorne," said he, "this morning on the Beuzeville road, you were seen to pick up the pocketbook lost by Maitre Houlbreque, of Manneville."

     The countryman looked at the mayor in amazement frightened already at this suspicion which rested on him, he knew not why.

     "I -- I picked up that pocketbook?"

     "Yes, YOU."

     "I swear I don't even know anything about it."

     "You were seen."

     "I was seen -- I? Who saw me?"

     "M. Malandain, the harness-maker."

     Then the old man remembered, understood, and, reddening with anger, said:

     "Ah! he saw me, did he, the rascal? He saw me picking up this string here, M'sieu le Maire."

     And fumbling at the bottom of his pocket, he pulled out of it the little end of string.

<  5  >
     But the mayor incredulously shook his head:

     "You will not make me believe, Maitre Hauchecorne, that M. Malandain, who is a man whose word can be relied on, has mistaken this string for a pocketbook."

     The peasant, furious, raised his hand and spat on the ground beside him as if to attest his good faith, repeating:

     "For all that, it is God's truth, M'sieu le Maire. There! On my soul's salvation, I repeat it."

     The mayor continued:

     "After you picked up the object in question, you even looked about for some time in the mud to see if a piece of money had not dropped out of it."

     The good man was choking with indignation and fear.

     "How can they tell -- how can they tell such lies as that to slander an honest man! How can they?"

     His protestations were in vain; he was not believed.

     He was confronted with M. Malandain, who repeated and sustained his testimony. They railed at one another for an hour. At his own request Maitre Hauchecorne was searched. Nothing was found on him.

     At last the mayor, much perplexed, sent him away, warning him that he would inform the public prosecutor and ask for orders.

     The news had spread. When he left the mayor's office the old man was surrounded, interrogated with a curiosity which was serious or mocking, as the case might be, but into which no indignation entered. And he began to tell the story of the string. They did not believe him. They laughed.

     He passed on, buttonholed by every one, himself buttonholing his acquaintances, beginning over and over again his tale and his protestations, showing his pockets turned inside out to prove that he had nothing in them.

<  6  >
     They said to him:

     "You old rogue!"

     He grew more and more angry, feverish, in despair at not being believed, and kept on telling his story.

     The night came. It was time to go home. He left with three of his neighbors, to whom he pointed out the place where he had picked up the string, and all the way he talked of his adventure.

     That evening he made the round of the village of Breaute for the purpose of telling every one. He met only unbelievers.

     He brooded over it all night long.

     The next day, about one in the afternoon, Marius Paumelle, a farm hand of Maitre Breton, the market gardener at Ymauville, returned the pocketbook and its contents to Maitre Holbreque, of Manneville.

     This man said, indeed, that he had found it on the road, but not knowing how to read, he had carried it home and given it to his master.

     The news spread to the environs. Maitre Hauchecorne was informed. He started off at once and began to relate his story with the denoument. He was triumphant.

     "What grieved me," said he, "was not the thing itself, do you understand, but it was being accused of lying. Nothing does you so much harm as being in disgrace for lying."

     All day he talked of his adventure. He told it on the roads to the people who passed, at the cabaret to the people who drank and next Sunday when they came out of church. He even stopped strangers to tell them about it. He was easy now, and yet something worried him without his knowing exactly what it was. People had a joking manner while they listened. They did not seem convinced. He seemed to feel their remarks behind his back.

<  7  >
     On Tuesday of the following week he went to market at Goderville, prompted solely by the need of telling his story.

     Malandain, standing on his doorstep, began to laugh as he saw him pass. Why?

     He accosted a farmer of Criquetot, who did not let hire finish, and giving him a punch in the pit of the stomach cried in his face: "Oh, you great rogue!" Then he turned his heel upon him.

     Maitre Hauchecorne remained speechless and grew more and more uneasy. Why had they called him "great rogue"?

     When seated at table in Jourdain's tavern he began again to explain the whole affair.

     A horse dealer of Montivilliers shouted at him:

     "Get out, get out, you old scamp! I know all about your old string."

     Hauchecorne stammered:

     "But since they found it again, the pocketbook!"

     But the other continued:

     "Hold your tongue, daddy; there's one who finds it and there's another who returns it. And no one the wiser."

     The farmer was speechless. He understood at last. They accused him of having had the pocketbook brought back by an accomplice, by a confederate.

     He tried to protest. The whole table began to laugh.

     He could not finish his dinner, and went away amid a chorus of jeers.

     He went home indignant, choking with rage, with confusion, the more cast down since with his Norman craftiness he was, perhaps, capable of having done what they accused him of and even of boasting of it as a good trick. He was dimly conscious that it was impossible to prove his innocence, his craftiness being so well known. He felt himself struck to the heart by the injustice of the suspicion.

<  8  >
     He began anew to tell his tale, lengthening his recital every day, each day adding new proofs, more energetic declarations and more sacred oaths, which he thought of, which he prepared in his hours of solitude, for his mind was entirely occupied with the story of the string. The more he denied it, the more artful his arguments, the less he was believed.

     "Those are liars proofs," they said behind his back.

     He felt this. It preyed upon him and he exhausted himself in useless efforts.

     He was visibly wasting away.

     Jokers would make him tell the story of "the piece of string" to amuse them, just as you make a soldier who has been on a campaign tell his story of the battle. His mind kept growing weaker and about the end of December he took to his bed.

     He passed away early in January, and, in the ravings of death agony, he protested his innocence, repeating:

     "A little bit of string -- a little bit of string. See, here it is, M'sieu le Maire."
